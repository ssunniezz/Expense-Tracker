# Expense Tracker

A Flutter project to keep track of your expense and record them into as much as category as you wish.

<h3>Pains Point</h3>

- At the end of the month, you found out that you have spent a lot of money, but you have totally no idea what have you been spending for the whole past month.

- With this app, you can easily make records of your expenses into your own customizable categories, and also provides a summary for your total expenses.
